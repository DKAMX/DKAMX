# Current  
Greetings! My name is Max, and I am currently a third-year student studying Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington.  
I have a keen interest in both Cyber Security and Game Development. Currently, I create games using Unity.  

What else?  
I make mods and modding tools for Barotrauma, one of my favorite games.
